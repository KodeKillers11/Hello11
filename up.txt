

THE HACKATHON WAS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE THAT BROADENED OUR HORIZONS AND PUSHED OUR BOUNDARIES. 
We worked together to do, in a short period of time, what we would never be able to do under normal circumstances. 
It helped us bond and find our strengths and weaknesses. 
We collaborated in the most eficient way possible and learnt to work under pressure.
This hackathon helped us build our analytical skills and to see the bigger picture at every step.
It also, to a certain extent, gave us insight about the company's functionalities. 
It helped us become more technically proficient, helpimg us develop our soft skils in the process.
On behalf of my colleagues, I wish to thank the organization for building the perfect foundation for a successful career ahead at Verizon.
We hope to participate in many such events and learn and grow in the process.

Thanking you.

Yours
